## Great color game developed using JavaScript  
There will be six color boxes on screen and you have to click on corect box. Correct color box can be identified from the RGB color channel displayed on the top of the page. If you think six color boxes are hard to guess you can switch to easy mode. In easy mode there will be only three color boxes.
